    dialogue: Newcomer! How on earth did you get here? The Lurkers destroyed the
      road a few weeks ago!
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4f14e5640dd40594b949ad997bcc2fc1, type: 2}
    dialogue: Oh, I just hopped on over it. It was a little tricky getting past the
      Lurkers, though, but I whacked them with my stick.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 24600badf59bab34c9a96c9827a9c650, type: 2}
    dialogue: You WHAT?
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4f14e5640dd40594b949ad997bcc2fc1, type: 2}
    dialogue: I. . . whacked them. A buncha times.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 24600badf59bab34c9a96c9827a9c650, type: 2}
    dialogue: WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU "WHACKED THEM?" None of us can touch Lurkers without
      dying!
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 24600badf59bab34c9a96c9827a9c650, type: 2}
    dialogue: If all of us could just take a stick and go wild, the Lurkers wouldn't
      even be here by now! But no, we have to avoid them.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 24600badf59bab34c9a96c9827a9c650, type: 2}
    dialogue: There's something up about you. You've wandered in here the same time
      that they. . . hmm . . . you know what?
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 24600badf59bab34c9a96c9827a9c650, type: 2}
    dialogue: I know who you are. If you clear out the Lurkers by the shopping mall,
      I'll tell you more.
